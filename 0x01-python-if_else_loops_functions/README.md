<h1>0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions</h1>
<p>These project aims at understanding Python conditional statement and loops.</p>
<p>The tasks under this directory are guided to understand the following python statements/ control of flow statements: </p>
<ol>
<li>if, if...else statement: Checks whether a condition is true or false.</li>
<li>while loop: Iterates over a block of code statements until a given condition is met.</li>
<li>for loop: Iterates over a block of statements until condition is met. Increment function is embedded in the loop statement unlike the <em>while</em> loop.</li>
<li>break: get out of a loop when a conditon is not met</li>
<li>continue: go on with the loop skipping the given condition</li>
<li>pass: skips an unused condition in the Python interpreter to prevent error while implementing code.</li>
<li>range: works in hand with the for loop to iterate over within a given range of iteration.</li>
<li>return: returns a value to a function</li>
</ol>
